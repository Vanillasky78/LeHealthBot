# NLP-Assessment-24-25
Template repo for the mini-project assessment on the unit IUI000131 Natural Language Processing for the Creative Industries.

For your assessment you should make a new repository based of this template. Your chatbot class should inherit from the base class `ChatbotBase` and you should write new functions that override the basic functions given in this template.

As you develop your own chatbot you should make regular commits using git to track and save the progress of your work. It is a requirement for you to make at **least 3 commits** to show the progress of your work. 

Your submission for the mini-project will be a link to your own git repo that is based of this template class.

### Getting started

Make a new file for your chatbot, e.g. `my_chatbot.py`

In that file you will need to include the line: 
```
import ChatbotBase from chatbot_base
```

In your new file make a new class that inherits from ChatbotBase, e.g.:
```
class MyChatbot(ChatbotBase):
```

The file `run_chatbot.py` should contain the code where your chatbot runs. 

Below is a basic example of what this might look like.

```
from my_chatbot import MyChatbot

if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    chatbot = MyChatbot()
    chatbot.greeting()

    response = chatbot.respond('How are you?')

    while chatbot.conversation_is_active():
        response = chatbot.respond(response)
    
    chatbot.farewell()
```

Your are not limited just to the core functions in the base class ChatbotBase. Feel free to add more functions to your chatbot class if you want your chatbot to have more complex behaviour's or functionality.

The instructions for how to run my chatbot code:
conda activate nlp
python run_chatbot.py

This will start the chatbot, and you should see the greeting message from LeChefAI:
Hello! I am LeChefAI, your cooking assistant!
I can help you find healthy recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand.
You can ask me for meal ideas, seasonal ingredients, cooking tips, or recipes based on a specific ingredient!

For example, you can say:
 - 'Seasonal ingredients for fall'
 - 'Give me meal ideas with chicken'
 - 'Give me cooking tips'
 - 'Recipes for apple'

How to Interact with the Chatbotï¼š
After the chatbot greets you, you can enter text commands to interact with it. Below are some examples of what you can ask the chatbot:

Ask for meal ideas based on ingredients:
Example: meal ideas with chicken

Ask for seasonal ingredients:
Example: seasonal ingredients for fall

Request recipes based on an ingredient:
Example: recipes for apple

Ask for cooking tips:
Example: cooking tips

To exit the chatbot, type exit, quit, or bye.

Example of a Full Session:
You: seasonal ingredients for fall
LeChefAI: Seasonal ingredients for fall: pumpkin, sweet potato, apples, carrot

You: meal ideas with chicken
LeChefAI: Try making a chicken salad, grilled chicken with vegetables, or a chicken stir-fry!
